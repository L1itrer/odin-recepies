        <li>Cook the potatoes in salted water without peeling them. Once they're soft strain them and peel. Cut them into small pieces and grill. You can use a grilling pan of normal frying pan if you don't have one. You can also skip grilling them if you're in a hurry.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs in salted water until they're hard-boiled.</li>
        <li>Cut the bacon into small pieces. Fry it or cook it inside an oven. </li>
        <li>Peel all broad been and put them on a serving platter as the base of the salad. On top of the beans add a layer of grilled potatoes. Cut the eggs into small pieces and add them on top as well. Finally cover the eggs in bacon.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce. In a bowl mix all ingredients until they're one substance.</li>
        <li>Cover the salad in sauce. Chop the chives and sprinkle it on top of the sauce. The salad is finished</li>
